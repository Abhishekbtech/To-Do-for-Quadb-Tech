# A Simple React To-Do Application
Build a simple React To-Do application that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks. The application should demonstrate understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, hooks, and state management using Redux.

## Features
1. Add Task: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
2. View Tasks: Displays all added tasks in a list format.
3. Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
4. Edit Task: Each task has an edit button that, when clicked, opens a task popup from the list.

## Bonus Features (Optional):

- Implement persistent storage using local storage to save tasks, so they are not lost on page reload.
<!-- Mark tasks as completed without deleting them by toggling the task's state and styling. -->
